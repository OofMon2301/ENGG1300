## 1.1 Course Details
In ENGG1300, students will be introduced to electrical circuits & systems. They'll explore the solution of simple AC and DC Circuits, delve into electrical units & measurements and understand voltage, current, and impedance. They will also familiarize themselves with equivalent circuits, electrical energy & power, resistors, inductors, capacitors, phasors, and filters. This course also provides an introduction to analog and digital telecommunication systems, operational amplifiers, sensors & actuators, simple controllers. In labs, students will have hands-on experience with laboratory instruments, simulators, and mathematical software tools.

## 1.2 Course Introduction
ENGG1300 is a general introductory course to electrical and electronic engineering. This course will teach the fundamentals of AC and DC circuit theory, electrical analysis of simple networks, behavior of passive and some active electronic components. Active Learning Lab classes will reinforce lecture material and teach practical skills in the use of basic test and measurement equipment and the use of circuit simulations.

The on-campus nature of this course requires that you are able to attend for: 2*2hr practical classes per week, a mid-semester exam in week 7, a demonstration assessment in week 11, and the on-campus final exam.

## Course Changes in Response to Previous Student Feedback
We have made several changes to this course in response to student feedback:

- Increase in the weighting of the demonstration assessment to 10% from 5% to reflect the associated workload for students
- Updates to practical lecture examples in power and communications engineering to reflect current engineering challenges in Australia
- More formative feedback during practical classes.

## Assumed Background
Students are expected to have an understanding of the basics of differential and integral calculus and complex arithmetic. Those who have not completed specialist mathematics or Maths C at high school, or MATH1050 at UQ should enroll in MATH1050 concurrently with ENGG1300.
